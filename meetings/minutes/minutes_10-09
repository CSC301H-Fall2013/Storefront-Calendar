We discussed our user stories at length, and made headway into rewriting them to be clearer, more concise. In accordance with Jaime's requests, we de-prioritized client user stories, and prioritized administrator user stories. Some user stories were discarded as untestable, unrealistic, or too poorly defined. All user stories were estimated and prioritized. The new user stories are found in sprint1/user_stories_v2.xls.
