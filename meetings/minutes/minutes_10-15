Minutes - 10 / 15

We had an unscheduled meeting after class.

We set up a scrum board on Trello.

We decided to implement the following user stories first: Priority #'s 2, 3, and 4.

(As an administrator, I need to be able to ... )
... add a new client to the system, along with their information, so that I can quickly sign up clients during meetings. I would like to have a dashboard/panel for these kinds of administrator tasks. I want to have the system automatically email our new clients a username and a randomly generated temporary password when their account is created.
... modify / update client details, by clicking on the client's name wherever it appears in the application, so that I can perform this task without interrupting my workflow any more than necessary.
... see a calendar view of any month, with events listed in each day, so that I have an overview of events coming up, and manage my time wisely.

We broke up those user stories into tasks. Those are listed under things 'to do' in Trello.
