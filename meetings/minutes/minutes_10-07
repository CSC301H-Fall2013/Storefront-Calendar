Minutes - 10 / 02

We decided to change our Wednesday meeting to 1-3pm, in Robart's library. Clark reserved the room.

We decided that each of us would rate each user story individually. Then, on Wednesday we can compare ratings and prioritize user stories. Jaime has already mentioned that the administrator's user stories should take priority; this will be accounted for during prioritization.

A new design idea for the front page was discussed; it has yet to be implemented (Zhenya)

A preliminary schema for our database (found in sprint1/db-schema) was drawn up (JP).

Progress has been made on creating a clickable map-view (Matt) and calendar-view (Steven & Zhenya).
