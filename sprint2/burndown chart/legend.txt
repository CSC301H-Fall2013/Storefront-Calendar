Expected velocity
----------------

Expected Velocity = hours/ days
		  = 51 hours/12 days
		  = 4.25 hours/day

Actual Velocity
----------------

Actual velocity = (96-80)hours / 12days
		= 16/12
		1.333 hours/day

Conclusion
---------
We know the velocity is much slower than expected, however all the backend works for booking and edit bookings are done. Hence, in next few days a lot of works will be done in short period of time.
