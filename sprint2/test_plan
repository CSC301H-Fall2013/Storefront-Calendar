Test Plan


Tests in this test plan should be carried out whenever a change is made to the code that may affect
the validity of the procedure as outlined.
e.g. Whenever a change is made to the user table in the DB, or the login controller, or the front
     page's UI/design, the 'Login' test case should be run.


The deployed website is located at:
http://thestorefront.cloudapp.net/html/account/index

The following login credentials will always be present in the DB:
(Admin-level)    User: testing    Pass: testing
(Client-level)   User: client     Pass: client


Test: Login, Logout
    1. Navigate to the main page.
    2. Enter the Admin-level credentials in the required fields, and press 'enter'.
    3. The menu in the top left hand corner should include admin-level options, e.g. 'Add new user'.
    4. Click the logout button in the top right hand corner to logout.
    5. You should be redirected to the main page, which should appear the same as in step 1.
    6. Enter the Client-level credentials in the required fields, and press 'enter'.
    7. The menu in the top left hand corner should NOT include admin-level options, e.g. 'Add new user'.
    8. Click the logout button in the top right hand corner to logout.
    9. You should be redirected to the main page, which should appear the same as in step 1.
