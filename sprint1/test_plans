Testing Plan
============

## User Story #17
As an administrator, I want to be able to add a new client to the system, along
with their information, so that I can quickly sign up clients during meetings.
I would like to have a dashboard/panel for these kinds of administrator tasks.
I want to have the system automatically email our new clients a username and a
randomly generated temporary password when their account is created.

__Test Case 1__
    - Login with (admin, client, user)
        - Hover over actions, go to add new client page (only admin)
            - try empty fields for everything (only address and phone are allowed to be empty)
            - try empty name, filled in address and/or phone
            - try name, address and phone filled in
        - Confirm that it was successfully added to the database
    - Logout

__Test Case 2__
    - Login with (admin, client, user)
        - Hover over actions, go to add new client page (only admin)
            - Fill in a name and an email that we can check to ensure we got the email
            - Fill in no name, and a valid email (ensure no email was sent)
            - Fill in a name, and no email (should not try to email anyone)

## User Story #18
As an administrator, I want to be able to modify / update client details, by
clicking on the client's name wherever it appears in the application, so that I
can perform this task without interrupting my workflow any more than necessary.

__Test Case 1__
    - Login with (admin, client, user)
        - Hover over actions, go to edit client (only admin)
            - Look at drop down, should list all clients
            - Make no changes (ensure no changes are made in db)
            - Make a change to any field (ensure correct changes made in db)
    - Logout

## User Story #30
As an administrator, see a calendar view of any month, with events listed in
each day, so that I have an overview of events coming up, and manage my time
wisely.

__Test Case 1__
    - Login with (admin, client, user)
        - Click on month view
            - See an event title
