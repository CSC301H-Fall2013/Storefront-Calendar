We mainly worked together the to finish off our final release. Work was split between the memebers of the group and managed to complete the folowing tasks. Manual testing been done to insure our website would work properly. Our website was deployed since sprint 0, any commits will be deployed, so no installation are needed. One of our memebers put together a manual in LaTeX and another made a user friendly demo video with a voice over. We also managed to finish our development process review and release notes.
