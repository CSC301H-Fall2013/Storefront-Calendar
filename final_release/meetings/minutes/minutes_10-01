Minutes - 10 / 01

We talked about the user interface. Different views were talked about, and some were added to the project charter.

We discussed technologies we might need - PHP, etc. The project charter was modified accordingly.

Last meeting we emailed Jaime requesting a conference call. Jaime responded that was possible, and we requested today at 5pm, but she did not confirm. We tried to call Jaime at the Storefront. She did not answer. Storefrontâ€™s website hosting is suspended (?!) so she might be busy.
