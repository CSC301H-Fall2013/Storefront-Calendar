Member Obligations

Every team member is obligated to attend group meetings whenever possible, and be on time for them.

Team members must keep in contact with the group by checking all group forums on a regular basis. The Facebook group should be monitored (we all have smartphones), and members should contribute if they can help with an issue. The GMail account should be checked whenever a conversation/reply is expected.

Members should ask for help from group mates whenever a problem cannot be solved alone.


Group Obligations

We, as a group, are obligated to meet all deadlines. We should communicate with the product champion whenever more information / clarification is needed about the product. Finally, we should work together to fully implement the product and aim for a high grade! ^_^
